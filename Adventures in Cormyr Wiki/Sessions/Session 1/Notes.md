## Your Warrant

You received your current mission while in Suzail, the capital of Cormyr.

You have been commissioned to cleanse a band of Shar-worshipping warriors that have crossed the border into Cormyrean territory.

- The commission comes from the Sage Royal, also known as Alaphondar Emmaras, though you have never met him personally.  
- This mission grants you a temporary warrant of adventuring, valid for two weeks.  
- Once expired, you will be subject to the full adventuring laws of Cormyr unless renewed.

## Things that happened

Bumped into a priest with papers mentioning Mystra

Our wagon was sabotaged. Identified and fixed this. Took photo evidence of the damage to claim money back.

We managed to peacefully separate the two shar worshippers. Big guy gave out some paper and turned to dust.

Extremely proud man turning from a statue to a man. Then a person knitting and the knitting catching fire.

Upside down mountains are nethereal, Resurrection hints (statues coming alive)

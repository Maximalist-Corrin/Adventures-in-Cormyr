He has a cockney accent

Strong and bold, a Asumar of tremendous size. He is wounded after fighting several abjurations in the kings wood. 

He can be found in a mossy nook, deep in the local woods. He's actively been hunted by aberrant hounds and monsters so wont have long. 

On his person is a hint to the identity of the chosen child, they will only get this if they reach him in time.

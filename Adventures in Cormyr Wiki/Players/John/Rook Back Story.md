Edrik Hale, known as [[Rook]], was born and raised in a modest village during the years leading up to the Paper Dragon Crisis. He was never formally educated in wizardry in his youth, but he was unmistakably brilliant. He apprenticed as a locksmith and developed a reputation for precision work. Over time he picked up multiple trades: tinkering, metalwork, masonry, driven by a fascination with how systems functioned and how they could be improved. 

He married [[Elara, Rooks Wife]], a thoughtful and community-minded woman devoted to her faith, though not clergy. She was compassionate, grounded, and a quiet pillar of the village. Together they had one son. 

When war came, their [[Isaac, Rooks Son]] was conscripted and killed. (Could do to flesh this out more really..) In the years following the war, [[Elara, Rooks Wife]] began to show signs of early-onset dementia. Perhaps brought on by the shock of loss. Rook responded the only way he knew how: he tried to fix it.

He studied herbal remedies, experimented with artifice, searched for arcane solutions. Nothing quite worked. The local church declared the illness beyond mortal healing. Whether due to doctrine, scarcity of resources, or indifference, they would not intervene. However, the "cure" was there. They simply wanted something in exchange for their healing: conversion to the church.

 [[Rook]] objected, but the progression of the illness frightened her more than he could persuade her otherwise. Shar’s clergy ([[Dathrys, Perceptor of Shar]]) offered what no one else would: a cure. And it worked. [[Elara, Rooks Wife]]’s memory returned. Her mind became clear again. She no longer forgot. But eventually it became clear that something else was also gone.
 
The warmth. The grief. The softness. The small irrational loves and attachments that defined her. She remembered everything, including their son, but spoke of it without ache. Without longing. Without spark. She claimed the pain was gone. That Shar had freed her. Rook saw it differently. The disease had been cured, but at the cost of erosion. Not memory anymore, but identity. Unable to accept that this was “healing,” Rook sold what remained of his livelihood and sought formal arcane study. 

He eventually made his way to Strixhaven, where he immersed himself in wizardry. He took particular interest in dunamancy, time manipulation, and any theory that might preserve or restore the integrity of the self. 

His goal became clear: To prove that the divine does not hold a monopoly on restoration. To transcribe the principles of healing from divine faith into arcane certainty. To create a system where no one must surrender themselves to be saved. 

Because research of this kind is frowned upon by most established faiths, Rook stole the amulet of a Trickery cleric, by the name of [[Istaak Voss, Trickery cleric]], to pass publicly as a cleric himself. A protective disguise to shield his arcane-divine experimentation from scrutiny. The theft was opportunistic, not murderous. The cleric still lives and may one day discover the deception. 

Rook left a replica in its place. Unbeknownst to Rook, the god of Trickery appears to find the situation amusing and has taken interest. Watching from the amulet he carries Rook does not seek to resurrect the dead. He does not seek power for its own sake. He seeks structural answers and redundancies. Options. Choice.

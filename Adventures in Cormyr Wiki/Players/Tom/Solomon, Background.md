They were turned as a child, they don't know anything about life before being a vampire, they just remember being locked up with a teddy and a pillow. Eventually they were introduced to the others who had been turned, some older, some younger. They never drank straight from a living person before, instead just leftover scraps, arms, legs, vessels filled with blood. They were taught how to speak, read and write but all still confined. 

Eventually they were given more freedom to roam. He learnt a lot about the outside world from books, especially of adventurers going on long journeys. They all learned how to charm, hunt and kill, but he was a slow learner and not good at it, at best he was good at charming but very good at blending in, but even then he would say things like "Would you like to share a bowl of blood with me?" Or "your arms are really veiny" Some of the older vampires planned an escape and he was part of it by proxy, but it went wrong, whoever the master/s were they knew, they hunted them. 

He escaped by blending in, wandering the city, perpetually looking for somewhere to rest it had been days, eventually looking into a jewellers and seeing perfection, just under a massive jewel, a soft white pillow... He snuck in to steal the pillow, the [[Genie, Shopkeepr]] found him, and after learning he was trying to steal the pillow and not the gem, burst into laughter. They agreed to a pact, offering powers to create a safe place they can rest. 

They tried to help out in the shop but scared customers away "This sapphire really highlights your arteries." So they were sent off to find out more about the world! As a person, they are a believer in the path of least resistance, they like being a background character per say. They will use disguise self to blend in. 

They are True neutral, they wouldn't kill for no reason, but they do see it as a fact of life. They see drinking blood the same as drinking water, they aren't just going to drink from your cup but if there is a dead body they dont see the difference. 

They quickly found out it was frowned upon, not because they were caught, but because they brought everyone a cup of blood to make friends. During that time they discovered the joys of comfort, they have been stealing pillows so their dimension is basically a pillow fort, and discovered how hot chocolate is the best drink, 2nd to blood.

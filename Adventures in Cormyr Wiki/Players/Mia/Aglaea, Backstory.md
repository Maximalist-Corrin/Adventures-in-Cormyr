I was born and raised entirely within the borders of my homeland, an elven kingdom whose culture and architecture were shaped by celestial ideals rather than religion. The realm did not worship gods, nor did it claim divine mandate, but it believed itself closer to the heavens than other kingdoms: orderly, principled, and elevated in both conduct and design. The presence of aasimar among the population was seen as proof of this closeness rather than a miracle. As such, the kingdom’s elite military forces were composed almost entirely of aasimar, not as clergy or holy warriors, but as living symbols of continuity, legitimacy, and protection.

From early adulthood, I served as part of this elite force. I had never travelled beyond the kingdom’s borders and had little interest in the wider world. My duty was inward-facing: to protect the Crown and ensure the stability of the realm. My oath was sworn directly to the royal family, not to a god, and not to an abstract moral ideal.

When the invasion began, it did not come as a conventional war. Portals opened across the kingdom, releasing creatures from another plane- aberrant, hostile, and unlike anything recorded in our histories (thinking a precursor to the paper dragons, or Mind flayers would work really nicely too). As the situation deteriorated, the military was divided into two forces. One remained behind to defend the population and delay the advance. The other was ordered to enter the portals themselves, to strike at the source of the invasion and end the threat decisively. I was assigned to the offensive force. We viewed as abandoning the kingdom, but as a different form of protection: if the source could be destroyed, the realm could survive. My unit passed through one of the portals fully expecting either victory or death.

We succeeded in destroying the enemy’s command structure on the other side. Against all expectation, we were also able to reopen a return portal (unsure if there would be mechanisms that would open it up, if we had members trained in planier magic, or if it was sheer luck). When we stepped back through, we believed we were returning home.

We were not.

The land was utterly changed. The terrain, the layout of the city, and the architecture were unfamiliar. Roads ended in wrong places, buildings were shaped incorrectly, and the styles were inconsistent with the elven design we knew. At first, we believed we had emerged in the wrong location or even the wrong world. What ultimately told us the truth was the castle ruins. Beneath collapsed walls and overgrown foundations, the material itself was unmistakable- the same pale, worked stone quarried and shaped only in our homeland. It was through this that we realised we were standing in the ruins of our own capital.

Through interactions with locals in a nearby village and surviving records, we learned what had happened. Our kingdom had fallen. No forces were recorded as having returned from the portals. The war dragged on for centuries after our disappearance, only ending long after our people were gone. Our realm was remembered, but only as a failed resistance, a footnote in a longer history of aberrant incursions and planar instability.

We remained among the ruins for some time, attempting to understand what had been lost. Eventually, we were discovered by a travelling elf,  a [[Elf, Historian]] affiliated with a college and specialising in the history of our almost forgotten realm. Through cautious discussion, it became clear that they were the descendant of a royal advisor who had served during the war. That advisor had been entrusted with a final contingency: the protection of the infant heir ([[Child of Promise]]). The king and queen had sent their child away under secrecy before the kingdom’s fall, tasking the advisor with ensuring the survival of the royal bloodline.

The advisor lived long enough to see the kingdom collapse, but never learned what became of the child.

The [[Elf, Historian]] shared what fragmented knowledge remained. The royal bloodline did survive, but only in diluted form. Over centuries, elven blood thinned through human generations. Titles vanished, names changed, and the lineage lost all political power. Through incomplete genealogical records, marriage registries, inheritance documents, and a single recorded birth; a possible living descendant was identified. The record lists only the parents, not the child’s name, gender or current whereabouts. The child would now be a young human, no more than six years old at the time the record was last updated.

A certain marker persisted in the family line, heterochromia. One yellow eye recurring generation after generation. I do not know where this child is. Only that they exist.

With this knowledge, the remaining members of my order separated, each pursuing different paths to uncover fragments of the truth or prevent the bloodline from being erased entirely. I have taken to the wider world for the first time, carrying an oath sworn to a kingdom that no longer exists, seeking an heir who does not know they are one, and serving modern authorities only insofar as it allows me to continue protecting what remains of the Crown.

Personal Oaths (as sworn and practiced)
These oaths are not religious in nature and predate my paladinhood as it is now understood.

I shall protect and serve the Crown and the Kingdom.
This oath was sworn directly to the royal family. Though the kingdom has fallen, I consider the bloodline itself a continuation of that duty.

I shall uphold the honesty of the realm wherever possible.
I do not lie in Celestial. When truth would endanger others, I speak it only in the tongue of my homeland.

When coin passes from my hand to another, or from another to mine, it shall be acknowledged in the King’s Tongue.
In Elvish, I speak a traditional phrase: “May this coin buy you flight, so you may also be closer to the Crown.”
This is a personal oath I have always kept, a reminder that obligation flows both ways.

I shall preserve and observe the holy days of the realm.
Though forgotten by the world, I continue to mark festivals, remembrances, and civic rites of a kingdom that no longer stands, so that it is not erased entirely.

I’m thinking I’ve been in this time for a few years at the point of the campaign starting. The [[Elf, Historian]] will have spent time adjusting us to the current world and teaching us common. But because everything is so new to me I will be cautious and pretend to know what things are even if I don't. I don’t openly tell people about my history, just that I’m ultimately on a quest to find a missing child of great importance. 

The creatures could have been:
1. Ancestors of the paper dragon creatures
2. Generic aberrations
3. Mind flayers (I thought they'd work really nicely time lore wise but I don’t know if realistically a small group of us could defeat a group of mindflayers)

I want to find out about the heir as my character does so please feel free to do whatever you’d like with them

## The Survivors of Fort Morning Lord: Heroes of the Paper Dragon Crisis

Though most are dead, missing, or unaccounted for, the name Fort Morning lord has become synonymous with resistance and sacrifice. Songs and half-truths surround the survivors who fought alongside forces from Baldur’s Gate, the Underdark, and New Elturel.

## Recent History

### The Defeat of the Paper Dragons

To the astonishment of all civilized lands, the Sword Coast was assaulted by a coordinated force of aberrant dragons later named the Paper Dragons capable of inflicting devastating psychic harm. These creatures could dominate, maim, and permanently scar humanoid minds.

The invasion struck with terrifying speed:

- The eastern Sword Coast was devastated.
- Even the Underdark was not spared, suffering some of the worst losses.

The conflict culminated in the Siege of New Elturel.

Survivors from the destruction of Fort Morning Lord joined forces with defenders from New Elturel, Baldur’s Gate, and the Underdark itself. Together, they confronted the great foe dragon.

The final battle was fought on the planes outside a ruined Elturel. In a desperate act, the survivors crashed their personal demiplane directly into the dragon’s forces, annihilating not only the dragon but its entire command structure.

Of that battle group, only one survivor is known:

[[Lady Katarina, High Queen of New Elturel]]

### The Rise of the lonely Queen Katarina

In the aftermath, it was revealed that much of New Elturel’s nobility had either been corrupt or complicit with the dragons.

With the noble class effectively erased, Lady Katarina was elevated to High Queen, replacing the old ruling council.

Her first acts were symbolic and final:

- Giant statues of her beloved fallen companions were raised at every major entrance to New Elturel.  
- A single statue to her mother stands at the city’s center.

New Elturel endures, but it remembers.

## The State of Cormyr

Although the war with the Sharran Empire of Netheril has ended, its consequences linger.

- Sembia, once under Netherese control, is viewed with deep distrust. Trade has resumed, but relations remain strained and heavily monitored.  

- Due to the kingdom’s precarious position, the Militant Dragons (Cormyr’s military) and the War Wizards (royal magical advisors) maintain a strong presence throughout the realm.  

- Adventurers are no longer tolerated without oversight. Operating as a group without a royal charter is illegal.

Queen Raedra has also taken a hard stance against internal weakness. Nobles who refused to fight during the war have seen their lands seized or redistributed, creating growing resentment among the aristocracy. 

Cormyr is stable, but tense.
